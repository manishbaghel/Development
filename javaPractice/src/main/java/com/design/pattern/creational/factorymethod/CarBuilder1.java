/*Lets list out the problems with these:

The CarBuilder class cannot incorporate change easily. If you get a new car type, you need to change the class to add methods to create the new car type.

The CarBuilder stores reference to the concrete car implementation. Thatâ€™s not a good design practice.

Lets say you have a new version of Mazda that extends the original vesion. Mazda2 extends Mazda. With this implementation, you would have to change the Builder class.
